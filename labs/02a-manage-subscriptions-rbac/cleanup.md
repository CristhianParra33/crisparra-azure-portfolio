# Cleanup — Lab 02a

## What I removed / reverted
- Removed role assignments created for testing (e.g., VM Contributor and custom role assignments to helpdesk)
- (Optional) Deleted the custom role: Help Desk Operator
- (Optional) Moved the subscription back to the original management group (Tenant Root Group), if this was only for lab practice

## Cost check
- Verified no leftover resources generating cost
